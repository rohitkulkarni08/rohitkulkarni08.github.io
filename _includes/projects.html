    <h3> Advanced American Options Pricing Chatbot </h3>
    <h3>Advanced American Options Pricing Chatbot</h3>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong><br>
      <strong>• Volatility clustering:</strong> Traditional models fail to capture rapid changes in volatility, reducing prediction accuracy.<br>
      <strong>• Dynamic market regimes:</strong> Inability to adapt to shifting market conditions leads to inconsistent pricing outcomes.<br>
      <strong>• Early exercise probabilities:</strong> Difficulty in modeling optimal early exercise behavior limits the practical usability of traditional approaches.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
      <strong>• Neural Network-based pricing platform:</strong> Combined traditional pricing models with trader-intuition features and liquidity metrics to enhance decision-making.<br>
      <strong>• Synthetic data generation engine:</strong> Simulated complex market scenarios to improve model robustness and adaptability.<br>
      <strong>• Scalable deployment on Google Cloud Platform:</strong> Utilized Vertex AI for scalable training and BigQuery for efficient data management.<br>
      <strong>• NLP-based querying tool:</strong> Enabled real-time scenario analysis and model comparison to support dynamic strategy adjustments.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br>
      <strong>• 35% improvement in pricing accuracy:</strong> Achieved better performance over traditional binomial models.<br>
      <strong>• Dynamic scenario analysis:</strong> Empowered traders to adjust key market parameters and analyze outcomes in real time.<br>
      <strong>• Enhanced model reliability:</strong> Synthetic data ensured robustness across varied market conditions, increasing trader confidence and usability.

    <h3>Word Sense Disambiguation in Biomedical Text</h3>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Biomedical literature is rife with ambiguous terms, making accurate information retrieval and analysis challenging.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> I applied Markov clustering algorithms to the PubMed dataset, effectively grouping contextually similar terms.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> This method achieved 85% accuracy in resolving ambiguities, significantly enhancing the precision of text-mining applications in biomedical research.</p>

    <h3>Image Super-Resolution</h3>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Enhancing image resolution without compromising quality is vital for applications ranging from medical imaging to security.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> I combined Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) with self-supervised learning techniques to upscale images by 400%.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> This approach not only improved image clarity but also resulted in a 75% reduction in storage requirements, optimizing both performance and resource utilization.</p>

    <h3>Stock Price Prediction with Sentiment Analysis</h3>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Predicting stock price movements is complex, with market sentiment playing a crucial role.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> I developed a hybrid model combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to analyze Twitter sentiment alongside historical stock data.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> This integrated approach achieved approximately 90% accuracy in forecasting stock trends, demonstrating the power of merging sentiment analysis with time-series forecasting.</p>

    <h3>Facial Expression Recognition</h3>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Accurately interpreting human emotions through facial expressions is essential for applications like human-computer interaction and security.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> I trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the FER2013 dataset to classify seven distinct emotions.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The model achieved 75% accuracy, and I developed a real-time demo that processes live camera input for immediate emotion recognition.</p>
