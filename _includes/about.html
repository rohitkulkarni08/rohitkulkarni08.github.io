  <p> Hi, I’m Ritik Rawat, a graduate student in Computer Science at Rutgers University, with a strong foundation in machine learning, natural language processing, and data engineering. My professional journey spans roles as a Data Scientist at Cognam Technologies and a Data Analyst at Increff, where I’ve led impactful projects — from developing facial recognition systems and enhancing regulatory workflows, to optimizing reporting infrastructures and streamlining data pipelines.</p>
  <p> I take pride in writing clean, efficient code, and in approaching problems with both analytical rigor and creativity. My academic background from IIIT Vadodara complements my hands-on industry experience, equipping me to contribute meaningfully from day one. </p>
  <p> Outside of work, I’m a guitarist and an avid reader, with interests in rock music, history, economics, and gaming — passions that keep me curious and well-rounded. I’m someone who loves learning and thrives in collaborative environments where innovation and continuous growth are encouraged. </p>
  <p> I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can apply my technical skills, creative mindset, and collaborative spirit to build meaningful solutions at scale. </p>
